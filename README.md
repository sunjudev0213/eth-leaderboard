# ETH Leaderboard
This web-application allows the display of transactions to an address on the Ethereum blockchain as a leaderboard.

**!!! Currently in development !!!**

See  **[Current State](https://eth-leaderboard.netlify.com//)**

### Primer
After the great success of the [Merry Merkle](https://merrymerkle.com) by [TrueBit Team](https://truebit.io/) - they managed to collect over 130.000â‚¬ in ETH donations for a local charity project, we at [Giveth](https://giveth.io) figured it would be great if more Ethereum projects could use such a tool.

After playing with our fork a bit, we still decided to build our own tool, because we found the original project very specialized for its cause and we would love to make a tool that can be of general use for many other developers down the line.
